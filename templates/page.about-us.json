            "richtext": "<p>In 2017, Shiny Storm was established as a small family business based at local markets on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland. This first small market range consisted of carefully curated Amethysts, Clear Quartz, Tourmalines and Citrines, hand-picked for four distinct qualities: authenticity, accessibility, affordability and beauty. The popularity of the Shiny Storm stalls proved that even those living in the most beautiful place on Earth need a little crystal love! <br/></p><h5>The Shiny Storm passion for crystals and their abilities to heal, connect and bring joy and love into people’s lives is obvious. <br/></h5><p>The quality of each crystal is critiqued before it reaches the Shiny Storm warehouse. The team is constantly assessing international suppliers to ensure the crystals are authentic and ethically sourced; ensuring the stones are not the product of human trafficking or slavery is of the utmost concern. All members of the Shiny Storm family have an outstanding knowledge of the healing powers of each stone, something they take great care to impart to each client. Underpinning every interaction with clients is the need to assist those who seek greater health and happiness to connect with their own powerful, healing crystals. It is because of this attention to detail and genuine love and care given to products and clients that Shiny Storm has expanded to several bricks and mortar shopfronts, an online store and more markets.</p>",
