They are incredible, cooperative and loving minerals, but they are not something to be exploited or ‘put to’ work. Rather their power should be nurtured, allowing them to become co-creators in your wellbeing journey to health and joy. Remember to trust your intuition when you are using your crystals. So often when I am speaking with my clients, they are uncertain, almost fearful of how to use their crystals: they don’t have the confidence to trust their instincts and really connect with their inner being. This is where we find the most joy, and crystals can help us get there.</p><p>Throughout my childhood, the earth would quite literally offer up its precious stones to me. I loved each and every one deeply and differently, but I had no idea that in return for the clarity, love or safety I was receiving from them, that I would need to care for my crystals as well. Through cleaning and honouring your crystals, you are recognising the vast journey it has undergone to get to you in this moment. This involves clearing or cleaning them.</p><h5>✧ Cleansing your crystals is an act of love, and when you love your crystals, you are loving yourself ✧</h5>",
